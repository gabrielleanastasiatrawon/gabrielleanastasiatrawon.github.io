            <h6 id="my">You know, it is hard being a big sister sometimes. I always feel like I have to act perfect, look perfect, be perfect in order for you to appreciate who I am. And yet, when I think these thoughts, I need to remind myself that I am human and so are you. Please do not make the same mistakes I have made.</h6> 
            <h6 id="my">I apologize for all the times I am super masungit. I want to be perfect all the time. But perfection is not attainable, so never break yourself in trying to reach it like I did. Do not make yourself someone you are not just to please the public eye. When the world tells you that you are nothing, remember who He made you to be. </h6>
            <h6 id="my">Do not live life searching for what the world can offer. Search for what God has already offered. Believe me, I have searched for worldly things and I came back empty handed, tired, and defeated. What God has offered you is healing, love, joy. He wants to be inside of your heart, guiding you to who you are meant to be. </h6>
            <h6 id="my">And through it all, the ups and the downs, I will be here for you. There will be times in this life when you have no one to be there for you, and when that time comes, please remember me. I will be here for you. Not just as a sister, but as a friend. I love you both very much.</h6>

            <h6 id="my">Thank you for giving me people to look up to. I cannot ever say this enough, but thank you. I promise that I am doing my best in everything that I am doing to make you proud. I know I never say this, but I love you all the most.</h6>
