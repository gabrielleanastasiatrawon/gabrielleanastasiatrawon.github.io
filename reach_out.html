            <h6 id="rea">I don't really know you, but I just want you to know that I love you.</h6>
            <h6 id="rea">It's something I've been coming to realize recently. I just love so many people. It's a good problem to have. Being surrounded by so many amazing individuals, I have found myself literally drooling at times over the crazy incredible people I have been blessed to have in my life.</h6>
            <h6 id="rea">At times, I feel a little insane when I talk about how much I am obsessed with certain people, but that's only because I see something in them that I admire and would like to bring out in myself. Sometimes I wish I could be like Oprah and be like, "YOU get a hug! YOU get a hug! EVERYONE gets a hug!," but I'm not here to act like love is always the easiest choice.</h6>
            <h6 id="rea">At times we may encounter some people who drive us up a wall, but they still have taught us something about the way in which we decide to carry ourselves. That's something worth loving them for.</h6>
            <h6 id="rea">Developing this appreciation for some might be challenging, but I will at least tell you it is worth the effort. In the end, you are doing yourself a favor by putting your judgments aside and giving people a chance to surprise you.</h6>
            <h6 id="rea">Sometimes I grow a little bitter when people stick to the idea that they can only love one person fully. They hunt for that other half to make them whole. But let me tell you something, it's not about finding another half, it's about finding another whole, because we are, and should be, whole on our own. Monogamy is very impractical. Just loving one person all of your life is a silly thing to chase after. We are meant to fully love several people.</h5>
            <h6 id="rea">My challenge to you is to love selflessly and unconditionally, for without love we are nothing. The more we put ourselves on the back burner and be people for others, the more likely we are to grow as individuals. After all, in order to be an influence, we must first be influenced. Find the crazy amazingness in the people around you and imitate that.</h6>
            <h6 id="rea">I'm not sure exactly what came over me to have this kind of mindset. It could have been a bug that bit me, an insightful dream, or hey, it might have even been some bad cafeteria food I ate, but no matter what it was, I'm so glad that I have I have learned to love love.</h6>
            <h6 id="rea">So to you, dear reader, I just want you to know that you are so loved. Even though I might not know you personally, I do know that there is something about you that is so crazy incredible. You might be blind to it, but there's people out there who wouldn't survive life without you. Never underestimate the power of love and how much both others and yourself are so deserving of it.</h6>
